and applying our skills to become more valuable in our devops journey.

for this first step we will be connecting 
to our remote repo on GITHUB and then configuring your username & email on git. 

Once that is completed, please create a branch and attach 
a vim file with the steps you took and upload it to GITHUB

Good luck
